    - Deep Integration with Browser's Media APIs
    - Ease of implementation for following
        - Animations
            - @keframnes
                - Vector Graphics to define the transitions on the HTML Elements

                - Vector Graphics
                - Device Independant Graphics Rendering 
    - Use the SASS Programming Model
        - Variable
            -  a Way to store information which can be reused
                - string, number, colors, boolean, lists, null
            - Sass Parser
                - Install using Node Package Manager
                    - npm install --global sass
                - Compilation tokens
                    - The '$' prefrix for varibales
                    - Global variable declarations
                        - !gloabl
                    - defining nested rules
            - SASS Modularity
                - Approach of Reusing the CSS
                    - Don't Repeate Yourself (DRY) 
                    - Create a SASS file i.e. scss and import it in other scss file for reusability
                        - Create a cache of reusable CSS
                    - The '@import' Directive 
                        - CSS @import directive makes an extra HTTP request to load the CSS each time

                        - SCSS is parsed (aka compiled into) CSS and then loaded in browserb so since the .scss file withe @inport is already compiled into CSS there is not additional HTTP Request for @import                        
                - What if the CSS code to be reussed across all the pages in a website?
                    - mixin
                        - Create an object that will be reused across the web UIs
                    - @mixin Directive
                        - Allows to use CSS code thatbcan be reused across website
                    - @include directive is created to make a use of the mixin
                    - Inheritance
                        - @extend
                            - Reusablity of css effects with Open-CLose-Principal (OCP)
                                - The CSS is open for Extension but closed for Modifiection      

# Bootstrap Components
    - Button Group
    - Dropdown
    - Navigation
    - Modal Dialog
        - The 'modal'
            - Leverage on the 'role' and data-toggel attributes on HTML 5
            - sub-classes
                - modal-dialog
                    - responsible to set the div as an 'on-demand' UI that will be loaded as an overlapping window on the current page
                - modal-content
                    - The body of Modal dialog
                - modal-header
                - modal-body
                    - AN interactive section of the modal
                - modal-footer
                    - displas the concluding section of the modal dialog e.g. showing buttons
# Using Media Services of the Browser to develop Browser Independent UI Rendering Sslutions
- @media directive 
    - CSS 3 used by all CSS Libs and Frameworks
    - Uses for following
        - Detect the ViewPort
        - Record the Height and Width of the Rendering space w.r.t. the parent andacrodingly arrange elements in it, this is device specific
        - Managing the Orientation lanscape and portraite 
        - resolution
